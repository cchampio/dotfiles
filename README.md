My dotfiles. 

The .vimrc in the pyvimrc branch is the closest I got to making Vim a full "Python IDE". I feel it is a lot of effort compared to just getting PyCharm (or some other IDE) and going to work. PyCharm with ideavim is a great workflow for me. I will keep my vimrc simple and use Vim for what it is best at and use an IDE for the tasks it is best at. 

Either way, if I want a Vim Python IDE this is a start.
